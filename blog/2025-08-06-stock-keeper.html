      <h1 class="title">From Inventory Manager to Stock Keeper</h1>
      <p><em>Posted on 2025-08-06</em></p>
      <p>In the world of modern airline retailing, the role of inventory is rapidly evolving. Historically, airlines acted as <strong>inventory managers</strong>, centrally controlling availability, fare buckets, and booking limits using legacy PSS-based systems.</p>
      <p>However, with the transition to <strong>Offer and Order models</strong> and IATA’s Modern Airline Retailing program, airlines are now embracing the concept of being <strong>stock keepers</strong> — custodians of seat capacity while dynamic offers are created externally.</p>
      <p>This aligns with IATA’s IBE Order principles, where:
        <ul>
          <li>Offers are personalized and dynamically generated</li>
          <li>Orders become the source of truth, replacing PNRs and EMDs</li>
          <li>Availability becomes contextual, not static</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>This transformation paves the way for airlines to move from passive distribution to active retailing. Platforms from Sabre, Accelya, and Navitaire are already enabling this shift.</p>
