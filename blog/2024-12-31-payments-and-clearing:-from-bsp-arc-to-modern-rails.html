      <p>Airline payments run on a mix of BSP/ARC remittance cycles, card acquiring, and emerging digital wallets. Modernizing does not mean abandoning clearing houses overnight; it means layering new rails while keeping accounting precise. Here’s how leading teams are approaching the transition.</p>

      <h2 id="current-state">Understand the current state</h2>
      <p>Document every payment type you accept and how it settles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Agency sales remitted via BSP/ARC with periodic billing.</li>
        <li>Direct credit card acquiring with daily funding and chargeback exposure.</li>
        <li>Alternative methods (wallets, instant bank transfers) with their own reconciliation files.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Knowing the mix helps prioritize which flows to modernize first.</p>

      <h2 id="modern-rails">Introduce modern rails safely</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Separate authorization from capture:</strong> Offers commit quickly, but captures wait until fulfillment milestones to reduce refunds.</li>
        <li><strong>Support tokenized payments:</strong> Vault cards securely so re-accommodation or ancillaries can reuse stored instruments with consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Add instant payout options:</strong> For refunds or compensation, consider push-to-card or real-time payment rails that delight travelers and lower costs.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation discipline</h2>
      <p>Whether funds arrive via BSP or a new API, reconciliation is the make-or-break step. Tie every payment transaction to the order line item. Automate matching between settlement files, gateway reports, and internal ledgers. Surface mismatches promptly with owner assignments.</p>

      <div class="box">
        <strong>Metrics to track</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Authorization approval rate by channel.</li>
          <li>Chargeback volume and recovery success.</li>
          <li>Average refund time per payment method.</li>
          <li>Breakage or unapplied cash awaiting reconciliation.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 id="compliance">Compliance considerations</h2>
      <p>New rails bring new obligations: PSD2 strong customer authentication in Europe, PCI scope for stored cards, local tax reporting requirements. Engage legal and finance early so the modernization roadmap accounts for licensing and audits.</p>

      <p>Blending BSP/ARC with modern rails is achievable when you treat payments as a product. Travelers get faster refunds, finance sees cleaner books, and you gain the flexibility to support new retailing models.</p>
