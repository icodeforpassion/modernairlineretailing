      <p class="has-text-weight-semibold">Published: July 30, 2024 - Modern Airline Retailing Team</p>

      <p>For half a century, airline retailing has depended on three artifacts: the PNR, ticket, and EMD. They worked for a world of static fares and channel silos, but today’s travellers expect personalised offers, transparent servicing, and consistent experiences wherever they shop. To deliver that, airlines are elevating the <strong>Order</strong> as the single, authoritative record that captures offer acceptance, fulfilment, and service history.</p>

      <p>The journey to orders is not a flip of a switch. It is a carefully managed coexistence between order-native capabilities and the legacy stack that still powers settlement, interline, and airport operations. This guide walks through five practical steps to make the transition resilient.</p>

      <h2 id="canonical-order">🧩 Step 1 - Define a canonical order</h2>
      <p>Start with a canonical order model that represents everything you sell. It should cover flights, ancillary products, payments, fulfilment status, servicing rules, and delivery metadata. Include legacy identifiers-record locators, ticket numbers, and EMD references-so the order can bridge to existing clearing and airport systems. Once committed, treat the order as immutable: append servicing events instead of mutating the record to preserve auditability.</p>

      <h2 id="lifecycle">🔄 Step 2 - Map the lifecycle clearly</h2>
      <p>Translate the canonical model into an operational lifecycle so teams know how orders progress from offer to completion.</p>
      <div class="table-container">
        <table class="table is-fullwidth is-bordered is-striped is-narrow">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Stage</th>
              <th>What happens</th>
              <th>Outcome</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Create</td>
              <td>Offer acceptance becomes an order, locking price, delivery promises, and servicing rules.</td>
              <td>Eliminates post-acceptance fare recalculations.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Fulfil</td>
              <td>Seats, ancillaries, and boarding credentials are issued directly from order data.</td>
              <td>Provides a single servicing record across channels.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Settle</td>
              <td>Revenue accounting reads order line items; tickets or EMDs are generated only where partners demand them.</td>
              <td>Simplifies reconciliation and revenue recognition.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Change / Cancel</td>
              <td>Change orders append to the original, maintaining a full timeline with financial impact.</td>
              <td>Preserves the audit trail for customers and regulators.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2 id="coexistence">⚙️ Step 3 - Build coexistence patterns</h2>
      <p>Most airlines will run legacy and order-native flows in parallel for years. Layer coexistence mechanisms that keep data aligned without stalling innovation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shadow PNR:</strong> Maintain a lightweight PNR for host synchronisation and store the locator inside the order for reference.</li>
        <li><strong>Ticket envelope:</strong> Continue issuing tickets or EMDs when clearing houses require them, mapping each coupon back to its originating order line.</li>
        <li><strong>Airport adapter:</strong> Expose order data as pseudo-PNR structures for DCS and airport partners that still rely on legacy messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid architecture:</strong> Introduce an Order Management layer above the host to safely deliver new retailing capabilities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="operations">🧮 Step 4 - Prepare operations for orders</h2>
      <p>Order-centric operations change how customer service, finance, and audit teams work. Equip them with tools that make order behaviour visible:</p>
      <div class="box">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Unified order timeline:</strong> Track every change event, the user or system that initiated it, and the financial consequence.</li>
          <li><strong>Embedded validation:</strong> Guardrails prevent servicing that conflicts with fare conditions, partner policies, or payment status.</li>
          <li><strong>Reconciliation dashboards:</strong> Compare order revenue, tickets issued, and settlement data to catch mismatches early.</li>
          <li><strong>Change management:</strong> Train teams on order concepts, retire PNR-centric scripts, and align KPIs to order success metrics.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 id="value">🚀 Step 5 - Unlock the value</h2>
      <p>When the order becomes the core record of truth, airlines gain measurable benefits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personalised retailing across web, app, and NDC channels.</li>
        <li>Faster time to market for new products and partner integrations.</li>
        <li>Improved revenue control through accurate, real-time reconciliation.</li>
        <li>Richer data for forecasting, pricing, and offer optimisation.</li>
        <li>Seamless customer experiences where shopping, servicing, and travel reflect the same record.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ultimately, an order-first approach decouples customer experience from host constraints while preserving the reliability of legacy infrastructure. Airlines can experiment, personalise, and automate without rewriting decades of core systems overnight.</p>

      <h2 id="faq">❓ Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <details class="box">
        <summary>Can we implement orders without replacing our entire PSS?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Start with an Order Management System layer that integrates with your host. Use shadow PNRs and ticket envelopes for interoperability while you build order-native flows.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="box">
        <summary>How does this affect interline and codeshare?</summary>
        <p>Synchronise via order events or APIs. When clearing or partner settlement mandates tickets, map each coupon back to its originating order line so reconciliation stays clean.</p>
      </details>
      <details class="box">
        <summary>What changes for revenue accounting?</summary>
        <p>Accounting reads data directly from orders and servicing events. Tickets and EMDs become external artefacts rather than the primary accounting source.</p>
