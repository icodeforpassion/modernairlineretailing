      <p>Moving beyond PNRs, tickets, and EMDs is less about a big bang migration and more about building an order record that can coexist with legacy systems. The order must be the source of truth for the traveler journey, yet you still need to settle, interline, and serve airports that speak the old language. Here is how modern programs make the transition manageable.</p>

      <h2 id="canonical-order">Define a canonical order first</h2>
      <p>Create a schema that represents everything you sell: flights, ancillaries, payment intents, servicing rules, delivery status. Include references to legacy identifiers (record locator, ticket number) so you can bridge to existing infrastructure. Version the schema and invest in contract tests—orders should be immutable once committed, with servicing events applied as separate records.</p>

      <h2 id="lifecycle">Map the lifecycle explicitly</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Create:</strong> Offer acceptance converts into an order with a committed snapshot of price and fulfillment obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Fulfill:</strong> Issue boarding privileges, seat assignments, and ancillaries based on the order, not a PNR.</li>
        <li><strong>Settle:</strong> Generate accounting events by reading order line items, even if you still produce tickets for external partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Change/Cancel:</strong> Append change orders referencing the original. Preserve audit history to explain charges later.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="coexist">Coexistence patterns</h2>
      <p>You cannot turn off legacy overnight. Adopt coexistence patterns that minimize duplicate data entry:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shadow PNR:</strong> Create a minimal PNR solely for host synchronization. Store the locator on the order and sync state via events.</li>
        <li><strong>Ticket envelope:</strong> Issue electronic tickets/EMDs only where clearing houses require them. Map ticket coupons back to order items.</li>
        <li><strong>Airport services:</strong> For DCS systems that still expect PNR updates, expose a read model that renders the order in their required format.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="operations">Operational readiness</h2>
      <p>Customer care, revenue accounting, and audit teams need tools built around the order:</p>
      <div class="box">
        <ul>
          <li>Searchable timeline showing every state change, who initiated it, and the financial impact.</li>
          <li>Inline validation that prevents agents from making changes that violate fare conditions captured in the order.</li>
          <li>Reconciliation dashboards comparing order revenue, tickets issued, and settlement files to catch drift quickly.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>The goal is not to wage war on legacy but to decouple the customer-facing view from the clearing constraints. When the order is the authoritative record, you can iterate on offers, servicing flows, and data products without rewriting decades of host logic in one go.</p>
